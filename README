# 📊 clinreport
**A Validated Library for Clinical Trial Reporting (TLFs)**

## 📖 Overview
`clinreport` is a centralized, high-performance library of R Functions designed to standardize the generation of Tables, Listings, and Figures for Phase I-IV clinical trials. 

---

## ✨ Key Features
* **Standardized Layouts:** Pre-configured templates for AE, Demog, Lab, and Disposition tables.
* **CDISC Integration:** Native support for **ADaM** data structures, including automated big-N and small-n calculations.
* **Multi-Format Output:** High-fidelity generation of **RTF, PDF, and Excel** files using ODS (SAS) or `gt`/`flextable` (R).
* **Automated QC Checks:** Built-in verification for "Zero-Record" domains and internal data consistency.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Primary Engine:** [R 4.3+]
* **Core Dependencies:** [e.g., dplyr, stringr, tidyr]
* **Validation Level:** **Tier 1 (Fully Validated)** - Includes Unit Testing and IQ/OQ/PQ documentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1. Installation
Clone this repository to your study-specific environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yongweiw88/clinreport.git

```

### 2. Basic Usage (Example)

To generate a standard Adverse Event Table:

```sas
/* SAS Example */
%mcr_ae_table(
    in_data  = adam.adae,
    out_file = output/t_14_2_1_ae_summary.rtf,
    trt_var  = TRTPN,
    filter   = %str(SAFFL = 'Y')
);

```

## ⚖️ Governance & Compliance

This repository is managed under a **GXP-compliant** software development life cycle (SDLC).

* **Version Control:** All changes must be made via Pull Request (PR) and require peer review.
* **Audit Trail:** Every function maintains a header log documenting the author, date, and validation status.
* **Traceability:** Outputs are tagged with the program name, data timestamp, and user ID in the footer.

## 🤝 Contribution & Feedback

For feature requests or to report a bug in the macro logic, please open an **Issue** or contact the Clinical Programming Lead.

### Pro-Tip for your Bio/README:
Since this is for TLFs, recruiters in 2026 will look for **"Metadata-Driven"** capabilities. 

**Would you like me to add a section on how these functions handle "Analysis Results Metadata" (ARM) for automated Define-XML generation?**
